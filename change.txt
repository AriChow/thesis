Abstract
---

* 2nd paragraph - fixed misspelling of Galerkin 

CHAPTER 1
---

* Section 1.1, 2nd paragraph - changed 'c.f' to 'cf.'

* Section 1.1, 3rd paragraph - change ' J: V \to R' to 'J: S \to R'.

* Page 3, 2nd paragraph - changed 'model solid applications'
to 'model solid mechanics applications'.

* Section 1.2,  2nd paragraph - change 'yield both effective error' to
yield effective error. This removes the confusing word both which had
no meaning in this context.

* Section 1.3, 1st paragraph - removed repeated word 'perform'.

CHAPTER 2
---

* Added 'Steady-State' to the title to make it clear we are
discussing steady-state problems (or quasi-steady w/ a single
load step).

* Equation (2.4) - Changed R on left hand side of equation to R_g.

* Equation (2.6) added period at end.

* Equation (2.8) added period at end.

* Section 2.3.3 - added a forward reference to point readers to
the section where error localization is discussed in greater
detail.

* Section 2.3.5 - Changed 'the coupling of the both analysis and
software components' to 'the coupling of the software components'.

* Section 2.5.2 - added a forward reference to point readers to
the section where the mechanics stabilization term is provided
mathematically.

* Section 2.6.1, 1st sentence - changed 'in a richer space the the'
to 'in a richer space than the'

* Section 2.6.1 - After 2nd paragraph - added a new paragraph
to explain exactly what is meant by 'uniform refinement' for
triangles and tetrahedra.

* Equation (2.21) added period at end.

* Equation (2.22) added period at end.

* Equation (2.28) added period at end.

* Section 2.8 - Attempt to explain a little bit about where the
global quantity 'G' comes from.

* Section 2.9.3, 1st paragraph - Correct misspelled word 'design'

* Section 2.10.1, page 33 - changed 'displays the evolution of
various during the adaptive process' to 'displays the evolution of
various errors during the adaptive process'.

* Section 2.10.2, page 38 - changed 'evaluation of the residual vector
fine space' to 'evaluation of the residual vector on the fine space'.

* Section 2.10.2, page 38 - changed 'While process of adjoint' to
'While the process of adjoint'

* Section 2.9.2 - renamed QoI to 'Integrated Solution Over a Sub-domain'
Changed all remaining references to this QoI to this new name.

* Section 2.9.3 - renamed QoI to 'Integrated von-Mises Stress Over a Sub-Domain}
Changed all remaining references to this QoI to this new name.

* All plots with error on the y-axis - rescaled to be relative errors
relative tho the exact QoI value J(u)

* Modified all instances of J (the determinant of F) to be j to avoid
confusion with QoI terminology.
